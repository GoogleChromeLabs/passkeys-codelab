description: SimpleWebAuthn is a TypeScript-based passkey library. Use this when implementing passkeys in Node.js/TypeScript using `@simplewebauthn/server` library.
---

- Look up on `generateRegistrationOptions.d.ts`, `verifyRegistrationResponse.d.ts`, `generateAuthenticationOptions.d.ts` and `verifyAuthenticationResponse.d.ts` for types.
- Use binary value for `userID` when invoking `generateRegistrationOptions()`.
- Use `requireUserVerification: false` for `verifyRegistrationResponse()` unless `authenticatorSelection.residentKey: "required"` on the frontend.
- Use `requireUserPresence: false` for `verifyRegistrationResponse()` if a registration request is for conditional create.
- `registrationInfo.credentialID` doesn't exist in `verifyRegistrationResponse()` result. Use `registrationInfo.credential.id` instead, which represents `string`.

* `credentialDeviceType` and `credentialBackUp` are `VerifiedRegistrationResponse.registrationInfo` properties.
* Use `isoBase64URL.fromBuffer` and `isoBase64URL.toBuffer` to convert between base64url `string` and `Buffer`.
* Append `verifyBrowserAutofillInput: false` to `startAuthentcation()` when the form is consisted of web components.
* When implementing `verifyAuthenticationResponse()`, pass in `credential` object instead of `authenticator` object, which contains: `id` for the credential ID as a buffer, `publicKey` for the public key as a buffer, `counter` for the counter as a number, `transports` for the transports as an array of strings.
